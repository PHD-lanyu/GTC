Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the most powerful weapon for various graph tasks due to the message-passing mechanismâ€™s great local information aggregation ability. However, over-smoothing has always hindered GNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs, Transformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via multi-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more immunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, **can we propose a novel framework to combine GNN and Transformer, integrating both of GNN's local information aggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate the over-smoothing problem?** To realize this, this paper proposes a collaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC architecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node information from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive learning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize self-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch, we propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with GNN to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As far as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation learning to utilize both GNN and Transformer to collaboratively capture different view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning. The experiments on real datasets show that GTC exhibits superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
